# Reportolia
!!! In development, not yet released !!!

Reportolia is a free Ad Hoc Reporting Tool for any Java-based Web Application. 

Creating Reports online is much simpler with Reportolia - just select Columns from the Table Tree, configure sorting and grouping, define row filtering, create data calculations and save a report - all this using intuitive online Report Creator Interface. 

- No Complicated XML-based report templates.
- No Desktop-based Report Creator Software needed.
- No Developer's involvement required.

Reports can be placed into public or private folders online and be ran at any time.
Reportolia can be deployed onto an application container of your existing Web-Application or be installed as a stand-alone app. Once deployed Reportolia reads tables, columns, table relationships metadata from your database and remembers it in its Data Model.


## Security

Reportolia has 2 levels of security:
- Page Security - helps protecting certain sections of User Interface per User.
- Row Level Security - allows you to declare table level security filters that will be appended to the report sql to limit amount of data per User.
